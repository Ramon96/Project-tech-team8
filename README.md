# About Zodimaniac
Zodimaniac is a dating platform designed to match singles based on their zodiac signs. The user is able to tell a little bit about themselves, post a picture and most importantly be able to match with others based on their zodiac signs.
If both users like each other than they have a match!

Both party's can engage a conversation whenever they like. Zodimaniac will make sure to provide the latest horoscope so that the users are able to plan their date ahead on the most desired day.
Unmatching at any point in time is also possibile.

Some of the actions a user can take are: 
* Register
* Fill profile
* Edit profile
* Find matches
* Like person
* Dislike person
* Chat with matches
* Unmatch
* Upgrade profile
* Receive notifications

# Focused feature
During this project I will focus on profile customization functionality.
**Job story**: When I sign up for a Dating site, I want to be able to create and edit my profile, so other singles can see who I am.

# Installation

**Cloning the project** 
`git clone https://github.com/Ramon96/project-tech.git `

**Installing node modules**
`npm install`

# This App is build using
* Code editor of choice
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* NodeJS
* MongoDB
* Lots of coffee ‚òï

# Documentation 
The app is build on a Express server. We use Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database.
Database settings are stored the dotenv file.

Your dotenv should look something like this:
```
DB_HOST = yourhost
DB_PORT = yourport
DB_NAME = yourdbname
USER_ID = 'youruserid';
```

During this project we make use of es5 notation.
The reasoning for this is that the dev team has more experience with this kind of notation.
Your Eslint should look something like this.
```
{
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "es5": true,
        "node": true
    },
    "extends": "eslint:recommended",
    "globals": {
        "Atomics": "readonly",
        "SharedArrayBuffer": "readonly"
    },
    "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaVersion": 2018
    },
    "rules": {
        "semi": "error"
    }
}
```
It is important to note to-do's like so:
`// TODO: Do the dishes`
During development we use VSCode and our code editor picks these Todo's up using the [TODO Parser](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=minhthai.vscode-todo-parser) plugin.

Please document your code using comments, and specify what a function does.

```
// This function makes the duck quack.
Function Quack(duck){
...
}

```

During this project we make use of [{{handlebars}}](https://handlebarsjs.com/)

// Your routes in logicall order

router.get('/', function(req, res){
    res.render('index', {
        title: "hello world!"
    });
});

router.post('/insert', function(req, res){
    // do something
});

//function declerations

function Something(){
